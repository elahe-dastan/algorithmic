## Introduction
In one of my interviews I was asked to answer to a question from [hacker rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) since then <br/>
I decided to solve more and more algorithmic questions cause it's so important in order to join a good company.<br/>
In this repository I solve algorithmic questions from hackerrank and save the here<Br/>

## FizzBuzz
Given a number n, for each integer i in the range from 1 to n inclusive, print one value per line as follows<br/>
if i is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz<br/>
if i is a multiple of 3(but not 5), print Fizz<br/>
if i is a multiple of 5(but not 3), print Buzz<Br/>
if i is not a multiple of 3 or 5,print the value of i.

## VowelSubstring
Given a string and a number 'k', we should find the substring with length k that has the most number of vowels if there<br/>
are no vowels in the string we should write 'Not found!'

## StringAnagram
Given a list of queries and a list of words, for each query we should return how many anagrams it has in the list of<br/>
words

## ValidSudoku
Determine if a 9x9 Sudoku board is valid. Only the filled cells need to be validated according to the following rules:<br/>

Each row must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.<br/>
Each column must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.<br/>
Each of the 9 3x3 sub-boxes of the grid must contain the digits 1-9 without repetition.

## 3Sum
Given an array nums of n integers, are there elements a, b, c in nums such that a + b + c = 0? Find all unique triplets<br/>
in the array which gives the sum of zero.

## Leader Board
Alice is playing an arcade game and wants to climb to the top of the leaderboard and wants to track her ranking. The game
uses Dense Ranking.<br/>
It should return an integer array where each element res[j] represents Alice's rank after the jth game.<br/>

climbingLeaderboard has the following parameter(s):<br/>

scores: an array of integers that represent leaderboard scores<br/>
alice: an array of integers that represent Alice's scores
## Magic Square
You will be given a 3*3 matrix (s) of integers in the inclusive range [1, 9]. We can convert any digit a to any other digit
 b in the range [1, 9] at cost of |a - b|. Given s, convert it into a magic square at minimal cost. Print this cost on a new line.
