## FizzBuzz
Given a number n, for each integer i in the range from 1 to n inclusive, print one value per line as follows<br/>
if i is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print FizzBuzz<br/>
if i is a multiple of 3(but not 5), print Fizz<br/>
if i is a multiple of 5(but not 3), print Buzz<Br/>
if i is not a multiple of 3 or 5,print the value of i.
